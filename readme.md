WhatWeather is a weather showing app that I've prepared in JAVA during my programming training with "Projekt Przysz≈Çy Programista".

With this app you can check the weather and weather forecast for any location in the world.
The application uses weather api: http://api.openweathermap.org . 

To use this code, you need to get your own API key from this page. Enter your key in model/Config.java
